http - hypertext transfer protocol
    - used for transfering web documents
    - sent in clear text
    - vulnerable to interception

https - secure hypertext transfer protocol
    - encrypts data retrieved by http
    - utilizes encryption algorithms (TLS)
    - utilizes TLS/SSL certificates that verifies the provider

    - when a user goes to a webpage, the webpage will send it's SSL 
    certificate and go through a process called SSL/TLS handshake

TLS - transport layer security
    - encryption protocol designed to secure internet communications
    - undergoes TLS handshake
        - two communicating sides exchange messages, verify each other, establish encryption algorithms, agree on session keys

SSL certificates
    - enable websites to move from HTTP to HTTPS
    - data file hosted in a website's origin server
    - make SSL/TLS encryption possible
    - contains the public key and identity of the website
    - receive a certificate from a certified authority (CA)
