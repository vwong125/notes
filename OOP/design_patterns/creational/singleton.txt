The Singleton pattern is a pattern to only have a single instance of a class

In order to do this, we must make the class have a private constructor and
the instance is only available through a static getInstance() method

example:

class Database:
    private static instance: Database

    private constructor():

    public static method getInstance():
        if Database.instance == null and acquireThreadLock():
            Database.instance == new Database()

        return Database.instance
