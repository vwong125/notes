Problem

    - You created an application that handles transportation of a truck, but
    you want to extend your application to support other transportation such as vehicles, boats, etc...


Solution

    - Create abstract classes of class to be created and a factory class,
    create a concerete factory for each concrete class. Leave the creation
    of the the classes to the factory.

Pros
    - avoid tight coupling between the creator and the concrete products
    - single responsibility principle: you can move the product creation code into one place in the program
    - open/closed principle: introduce new types of products into the program without breaking existing client code

Cons
    - code may become more complicated since you need to introduce a lot
    of new subclasses to implement the pattern
