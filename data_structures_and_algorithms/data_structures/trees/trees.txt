a tree is a data structure composed of nodes

    - each tree has a root node
    - the root node has zero or more child nodes
    - each child node has zero or more child nodes

trees cannot contain cycles otherwise it is known as a graph

Definitions
    - Trees vs Binary Trees
        - a binary tree is a tree in which each node has up to two children
        - not all trees are binary trees

    - Binary Tree vs Binary Search Tree
        - binary search tree is a binary tree in which every node fits a specific ordering
        property - all left descendents < n < right descendents

    - Balanced vs unbalanced
        - balanced enough to ensure O(log n)

    - Complete binary trees
        - every level must be fully filled except for perhaps the last level
        - filled left to right

    - Full binary tree
        - every node has 0 or 2 children

    - Perfect binary tree
        - both full and complete

Binary Tree Traversal
    - inorder
        - visit left, current, right

    - preorder
        - visit current, left ,right

    - postorder
        - visit left, right, current
