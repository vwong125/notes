a datastructure that implements FIFO (first in first out) ordering

utilizes the following methods:
    - add(item)
        - add an item to the end of the list
    
    - remove
        - remove the first item in the list

    - peek()
        - return the top of the queue
        
    - isEmpty()
        - return true if and only if the stack is empty

useful in certain recursive algorithms
    - push data onto a stack as you recurse and then remove as you backtrack
