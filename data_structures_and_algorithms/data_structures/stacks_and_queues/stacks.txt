data structure that adopts LIFO (last in first out)

utilizes the following methods:
    - pop()
        - removes the top item from the stack
    
    - push(item)
        - pushes an item to the top of the stack

    - peek()
        - return the top of the stack
        
    - isEmpty()
        - return true if and only if the stack is empty

useful in certain recursive algorithms
    - push data onto a stack as you recurse and then remove as you backtrack
