A data structure that represents a sequence of nodes.

In a single linked list, each node points to the next node in the linked list as represented:

| 1 | ----> | 2 | ----> | 3 | ----> | 4 | ----> None

In a doubly linked list, each node points to the next node and previous node

None  <-----| 1 | <----> | 2 | <----> | 3 | <----> | 4 | ----> None

Tips:
    - when working with linked lists, you need to keep a reference to head of the linked list as this is usally what we return
    - to delete a node from a linked list, modify the next property
    - runner method
        - iterate through the linked list with two pointers

    - recursion
        - a few problems utilize recursion
        - recursive algorithms take at least O(n) space where n is the depth of the recursion
        - all recursive algorithms can be implemented iteratively
